# Quiz Answers

Here you can find all the answers to the little provided quiz. Regardless anything, feel free to make me any suggestion that certainly will be helpful for me, if you consider it, please.

Although it is a simple repository with a few files, I consider relevant to create a directory to each one specifically. So, in the Answer directory you can find a folder for each answer. Just to make it clearer. 

Probably you expect test and validation for every problem, but I wasn't familiar with this approach of testing code. So, I discovered it with this quiz. I couldn't perform them.

You can find a direct link to each problem if preferred.

**The repository URL is the following:**

## Some remarks you may consider relevant about the answers for each problem.

The Quiz was provided with fifteen questions. Although the numbers indicate that there are sixteen questions there are only fifteen and the first of them is my name/email. So, it actually has fourteen questions to be answered. I considered the same questions number and I left them on the directories and files. So, you'll not find either the 'first' or 'second' problem, because it is starting with the third one.
