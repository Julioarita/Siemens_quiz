# Quiz Answers

Here you can find all the answers to the little provided quiz. Regardless anything, feel free to make me any suggestion that certainly will be helpful for me, if you consider it, please.

Although it is a simple repository with a few files, I consider relevant to create a directory to each one specifically. So, in the Answer directory you can find a folder for each answer. Just to make it clearer. 

Probably you expect test and validation for every problem, but I wasn't familiar with this approach of testing code. So, I discovered it with this quiz. I couldn't perform them.

You can find a direct link to each problem if preferred.

**The repository URL is the following:**

## Some remarks you may consider relevant about the answers for each problem.

The Quiz was provided with fifteen questions. Although the numbers indicate that there are sixteen questions there are only fifteen and the first of them is my name/email. So, it actually has fourteen questions to be answered. I considered the same questions number and I left them on the directories and files. So, you'll not find either the 'first' or 'second' problem, because it is starting with the third one.


## Third Problem:

I used a simple 'for' loop. I just look at the quotient, if it is equal
to zero, then the number is a multiple. I consider all conditions.

## Fourth Problem:

Considering our problem statement, performing the conversion is not required 
once confirmed that is possible to do it. Due to the fact that our return 
is a constant string and not the conversion properly.

The portuguese alphabet contain 26 characters, all of them included in 
ASCII table (1 byte). Starting from the decimal value 97 until to 122. I am not considering
spaces in the strings since the given strings consider only alphabetic characters.

There is a piece of code that is not require, as I mentioned above, due to the
purpose of our function once the conditions ```length(s) + length(t) <= k``` and 
```length(s) >= length(t)``` are true always will be possible to perform the conversion.

## Fifth Problem:

This one was the most tricky for me. I've been performing unit test in python not c++. So far, I have been trying to code a minimal Unit Test and I haven't achieved it properly, at least, not in the way I would have desire it, just a few poor results. I would need more time to do it. So, as my time is over I'll leave what I achieved so far.

## Sixth Problem: 


I used SQlite as interpreter of commands, but probably due to it is a simple query you can use any other SQL interpreter.

Although the problem statement says that it should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order when students 
grades (8-10) are the same, it seems that they were sorted by opposite way in the example.
As much as I understand, alphabetical order is descending order, so first letter is A, then B, then C and so on and so forth. 

Anyway, probably it was my misunderstood but I wanted to remark it.

## Seventh Problem: 

Although this example does not require a especific code file. I decided to backup my idea with a little example to better explain what I consider it is a case of polymorphism.

In my point of view we could consider as an example of method overloading and superimpose 
as well, but the use of the pointer to the base class is a clear example of polymorphism.
It seems like we are having just method overloading but we are using a pointer and references. 
So, to access each particular method in each subclass, we have to use a 'virtual funtion' 
in the base class declaration.

## Eighth Problem:
I used SQlite as interpreter of commands, but probably due to it is a simple query you can use any other SQL interpreter.

In this particular problem I wasn't given with any constraints so I decided to use `UNION`
which pull out all distinct values from both tables.

# Ninth Problem:

In this problem I used a ```.sh`` file to represent what I consider it would be the proper commands to perform every action.

## Tenth Problem:

It could be also possible to use a 'pointer', probably that would be the
best way to do it.
But we'll be constrained to vector length and I wasn't given with length restrictions.
Since I was not limited to the way in how to get the string, I decided to do it like so.

## Eleventh Problem:

Since I was not given any constraints related to input string length. I decided to use standard 'string' class to get the informed string by the user.

This problem was a bit tricky and took me a while to get across a solution. Basically, the idea behind the process is taking advantage of ASCII standard. So, adding a value to a ```char```variable results in another ```char```value. So, we can use this to 'mask' our letter and retrieve it in another parts of the code.
